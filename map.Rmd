# Summary:
The map titled "Regional Concentration (Canada)" shows the total border-crossing volumes at the top 30 busiest Canadian ports of entry. Each circle represents a port, and its size and color intensity indicate the total number of crossings. The data reveals a strong concentration of crossings in southern Ontario, particularly near the U.S. border around the Great Lakes, with far fewer high-volume ports in western and eastern Canada. The busiest port is Pearson International Airport (Toronto) with over 18 million crossings, followed by Trudeau International Airport (Montreal) with over 13 million. So, it also aligns with the result shown in Figure 3 that air will be the second highest crossing volumes in Canada.
